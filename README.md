# potato_clicker
This is a clicker game that I created with vanilla JavaScript. That said, I did utilize <a href="https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie">JS Cookie<a> and <a href="https://github.com/erosson/swarm-numberformat">Swarm Number Format</a> to simplify writing save functionality and large number formatting.

...it's a potato clicker because it's potato-quality, I focused solely on coding the functionality. Someday I will make it more robust!
